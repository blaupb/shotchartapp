# shotchartapp
R Shiny app and code that showcases interactive shot charts for NBA players, 1997-2025

This app within Shiny allows the user to analyze shot charts for any NBA player over the 1997-2025 seasons. To create this app, I utilized the [nbastatR](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/nbastatR/versions/0.1.12020301) package to get shot tracking data, various functions and **ggplot** objects derived and manipulated from another R [tutorial](https://github.com/DomSamangy/R_Tutorials/blob/main/1_Shot_Chart_Tutorial.Rmd), and **plotly** to allow for interactive data points for each shot chart. I also added summary statistics below each shot chart organized by type of shot attempted and two/three-point field goal attempted. I apologize in advance if the app takes a while to load. This requires an internet connection since the nbastatR function needs to pull online data. I hope you enjoy this work - feel free to use this code as you wish, and let me know your thoughts!
